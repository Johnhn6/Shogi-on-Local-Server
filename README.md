# Shogi-on-Local-Server
I decided to create a game project on the side. Instead of using a game engine, I decided to use html, css, JavaScript, and Java. I hope to show my knowledge and use of these tools, especially html, css, and JavaScript as I am beginning to learn more about these tools. The game I decided to create is a Japanese board game called shogi. It is, in a way, Japansese chess. I liked the game and I felt that it would be nice to recreate it instead of chess, as chess might be too common. An interesting challenge for shogi would be the implementation of the drop mechanic, which allows you to use captured enemy pieces as your own.

The program is a work in progress. I hope to complete it within the month.
